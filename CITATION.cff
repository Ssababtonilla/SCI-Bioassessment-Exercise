abstract: >
  A reproducible teaching/exercise repository for calculating Stream Condition Index (SCI)
  scores using the Virginia Stream Condition Index (VSCI) and Virginia Coastal Plain
  Macroinvertebrate Index (VCPMI) from benthic macroinvertebrate data. The repository
  includes an R Markdown workflow, supporting functions, example datasets, and a classroom
  assignment. The VDEQ methodology and original scripts are credited to Emma Jones (Virginia
  DEQ); she did not participate in creating this teaching exercise/repository.
